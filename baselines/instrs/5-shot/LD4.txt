Rule:
0. If the value of the continued attribute for x is 1, then the value of the tied attribute for x is annotated as 4.
1. For x, if the value 3 is associated with continued, then the value 3 is also associated with x's tied attribute.
2. For x, if the value 4 is associated with intense, then x is also characterized by the value 1 in the continued context.
3. If the value of the seasonal attribute for x is 1, then the continued attribute for x is marked with 3.
4. Within x, the value 2 is assigned to the underlying field if x is characterized by 4 in the seasonal field.
5. If the value of the tied attribute for x is 4, then the seasonal attribute for x is associated with the value 2.
6. If the relationship 'swap' holds between x and y, then the value of x in the seasonal context is determined by adding 1 to the value of y's seasonal attribute.
Assertion:
Bree's tied is less than 35.26.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Stormy is 0 seasonal; Fact5 & Rule6 & int0 -> int1: Chery is 0+1=1 seasonal; Fact4 & Rule6 & int1 -> int2: Bree is 1+1=2 seasonal; Rule3 & int2 -> int3: Bree is 3 continued; Rule1 & int3 -> int4: Bree is 3 tied
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Goldi carries Dela.
1. Dela feeds Lydia.
2. Under the relationship 'feed', Lydia feeds Goldi.
3. The value of Hanan's broke attribute is 4.
4. The unwilling attribute of Dela is represented by the value 1.
5. Dela carries Hanan.
6. Elonore carries Dela.
Rule:
0. If the value of 4 is assigned to the primary attribute for x, then the value 3 is naturally assigned to the unwilling attribute for x.
1. If the action carry is performed by x with respect to y, then the value of x's broke attribute is determined by multiplying y's broke attribute by 3 and adding 1.
2. Whenever the value of statistical for x is 3, it follows that the value of federal for x is 4.
3. If x has the value 1 in the context of broke, then within x, federal is marked with the value 2.
4. If the relationship 'spurn' holds between x and y, then x's unwilling attribute is set to nine times the value of y's unwilling attribute plus five.
5. When the relationship "feed" is established between x and y, the value of x's federal attribute is determined by multiplying y's federal value by 4 and then adding 9.
6. If x is assigned the value 3 in the context of broke, then x is also defined as having the value 3 for unwilling.
Assertion:
Lydia's federal is less than 25.25.
Step reasoning:
Fact3 -> int0: Hanan is 4 broke; Fact5 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Dela is 3*4+1=13 broke; Fact0 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Goldi is 3*13+1=40 broke; Rule3 & int2 -> int3: Goldi is 2 federal; Fact2 & Rule5 & int3 -> int4: Lydia is 4*2+9=17 federal
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. The relationship guard establishes a connection between Lorena and Donella.
1. Pietra is guarding Bernardina.
2. In the context of interest, Tiena and Donella have a shared connection.
3. Bernardina improves Lorena.
4. The relationship deduct describes the interaction between Tiena and Pietra.
5. Tiena shows interest in Pietra.
6. Tiena shows interest in Lorena.
Rule:
0. If the relationship `deduct` between x and y is fulfilled, then the value in the exchangeable field for x is determined by multiplying y's exchangeable attribute by 8 and then adding 7.
1. If the value of square for x is 4, then x is recorded with a value of 1 in the exchangeable field.
2. If the relationship between x and y is characterized by guard being met, then the value of x's exchangeable attribute is set to five times the value of y's exchangeable attribute plus 10.
3. If the value 1 is associated with x in the exchangeable context, then the value 2 is recorded for x in the no context.
4. Whenever the exchangeable field of x is set to 2, x is then documented with the value 1 under the aggregate label.
5. If the relationship `improve` defines the relationship between x and y, then within x, the `exchangeable` feature is associated with a value calculated by multiplying y's `exchangeable` feature by 6 and then adding 10.
6. If x is characterized by the value 2 in the context of defending, then x is attributed the value 1 in the exchangeable context.
Assertion:
Tiena's exchangeable is greater than 16.87.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Donella is 0 exchangeable; Fact0 & Rule2 & int0 -> int1: Lorena is 5*0+10=10 exchangeable; Fact3 & Rule5 & int1 -> int2: Bernardina is 6*10+10=70 exchangeable; Fact1 & Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Pietra is 5*70+10=360 exchangeable; Fact4 & Rule0 & int3 -> int4: Tiena is 8*360+7=2887 exchangeable
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Sallyanne is assigned the value 3 in the progressive category.
1. Mela obtains from Hiro.
2. Hiro obtains from Sallyanne.
3. Under the relationship obtain, Sallyanne obtains from or acquires what Shari has.
4. Under the relationship receive, Sallyanne receives from Mela.
5. The relationship receive establishes the interaction between Hiro and Sallyanne.
6. Mela and Hiro maintain a relationship as described by notice.
Rule:
0. If the value of progressive for x is 2, then x is identified with 3 in the massive context.
1. If x is designated with the value 2 in the soft context, then the mexican attribute of x is also assigned the value 2.
2. If \( x \) is attributed with 3 in the unstable category, then \( x \) is also attributed with 3 in the mexican category.
3. Given that x and y share a relationship denoted by "notice," in the context of "encouraging," the value of x is set to be 9 times the encouraging value of y plus 6.
4. If the relationship "obtain" defines the relationship between x and y, then x is marked with a value in the soft category, which is obtained by scaling y's soft value by 9 and subsequently adding 2.
5. If the value 3 is assigned to x in the context of mexican, then within x, encouraging is marked with the value 4.
6. For x, if the massive attribute is associated with the value 3, then the encouraging attribute is described by the value 4.
Assertion:
Mela's mexican is greater than 16.13.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Shari is 0 soft; Fact3 & Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Sallyanne is 9*0+2=2 soft; Fact2 & Rule4 & int1 -> int2: Hiro is 9*2+2=20 soft; Fact1 & Rule4 & int2 -> int3: Mela is 9*2+2=20 soft; Rule1 & int3 -> int4: Mela is 2 mexican
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Pierce and Marijo are connected through a buffet relationship.
1. In the context of Pierce, the value for disastrous is 3.
2. Manda suggests Pierce.
3. For Pierce, the value 3 is recorded in the changed field.
4. Marijo suggests Othilia.
5. Othilia suggests Etti.
6. The relationship 'suggest' defines the relationship between Pierce and Marijo.
Rule:
0. If the relationship "stab" is established between x and y, then x's recurring attribute is set to a value obtained by scaling y's recurring value by 3 and then adding 7.
1. If the attribute recurring is associated with x and has a value of 3, then x is also marked with the value 4 for the attribute disastrous.
2. When recurring is assigned a value of 4 in x, it ensures that narrowing is subsequently assigned a value of 2 in x.
3. If the recurring attribute in x is assigned the value 2, then under the narrowing context, x is also assigned the value 2.
4. If the relationship 'pick' is established between x and y, then the value of narrowing for x is set to three times the value of narrowing for y plus nine.
5. If the relationship 'suggest' holds between x and y, then within the context of recurring, x is assigned a value obtained by multiplying y's recurring value by 6 and then adding 4.
6. Given the relationship "stab" between x and y, the value of x's "changed" attribute is set to 3 times the value of y's "changed" attribute plus 3.
Assertion:
Manda's recurring is less than 23.05.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Etti is 0 recurring; Fact5 & Rule5 & int0 -> int1: Othilia is 6*0+4=4 recurring; Fact4 & Rule5 & int1 -> int2: Marijo is 6*4+4=28 recurring; Fact6 & Rule5 & int2 -> int3: Pierce is 6*4+4=28 recurring; Fact2 & Rule5 & int3 -> int4: Manda is 6*28+4=172 recurring
Answer:
False
