Fact:
0. Tedmund's leading characteristic is 3.
1. Sam punishes Tedmund.
2. Tedmund punishes Janot.
3. The relationship maximize connects Tedmund and Sam.
4. Ardene punishes Harli.
5. Janot punishes Ardene.
6. Harli gets Janot.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 1 for the characteristic apart, then x is associated with the value 4 for the characteristic huge.
1. When x is characterized by 3 in the domestic field, x is then characterized by 1 in the huge field.
2. Given that the relationship 'surprise' holds between x and y, the value of x's 'final' attribute is determined by adding 3 to the value of y's 'final' attribute.
3. If the relationship 'get' holds between x and y, then in the leading context, x is characterized by the value \(2y + 1\).
4. When the surprise relationship is established between x and y, the value of x's leading attribute is set to the value of y's leading attribute plus 2.
5. If the relationship 'punish' is fulfilled between x and y, then in the final context, x is assigned a value calculated by multiplying y's value by 1 and adding 3.
6. For x, if the value 2 is associated with x under the attribute huge, then it logically follows that the value 2 is also associated with x under the attribute leading.
Assertion:
Sam's final is greater than 5.26.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Harli is 0 final; Fact4 & Rule5 & int0 -> int1: Ardene is 0+3=3 final; Fact5 & Rule5 & int1 -> int2: Janot is 3+3=6 final; Fact2 & Rule5 & int2 -> int3: Tedmund is 6+3=9 final; Fact1 & Rule5 & int3 -> int4: Sam is 3+3=6 final
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Hamid and Archy have a relationship described by hamper.
1. Archy and Geo engage in a negotiation relationship.
2. The relationship prepare defines the relationship between Archy and Hamid.
3. Hamid prepares for Lanette.
4. Lanette is in a state of preparation concerning Geo.
5. There exists a relationship prove between Hamid and Archy.
6. The relationship negotiate establishes a connection between Marlin and Geo.
Rule:
0. If the value 3 is assigned to the improved property for x, then it can be inferred that the value 2 will be recorded for x in the professional context.
1. If x has the value 4 for the saudi attribute, then in the improved context, x is recorded with the value 3.
2. If the relationship `prepare` between x and y is satisfied, then the value of the developing attribute for x is determined by multiplying y's developing attribute by 2 and then adding 3.
3. Whenever the relationship 'prove' connects x and y, the value of x in the industrial context is determined by doubling y's industrial value and then adding 3.
4. If the hamper relationship between x and y is fulfilled, then the value of x in the professional context is determined by doubling y's professional value and then adding 3.
5. If x has the value 3 associated with the developing attribute, then it logically follows that x will have the value 1 associated with the supervisory attribute.
6. If x has the value 4 under the attribute developing, then x also has the value 4 under the attribute improved.
Assertion:
Archy's supervisory is less than 1.88.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Geo is 0 developing; Fact4 & Rule2 & int0 -> int1: Lanette is 2*0+3=3 developing; Fact3 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Hamid is 2*3+3=9 developing; Fact2 & Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Archy is 2*3+3=9 developing; Rule5 & int3 -> int4: Archy is 1 supervisory
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Melonie stores Dugan.
1. Nestor is displayed in relation to Bessy.
2. The relationship store connects Dugan and Nestor.
3. In Parker, the value for serious is 3.
4. Under the relationship store, Bessy relates to Melonie.
5. Nestor stores Parker.
6. Nestor and Dugan resemble each other.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 1 in the popular context, then it is expected that the value 4 will be assigned to x in the serious context.
1. When the value of held for x is 3, the value of serious for x becomes 1.
2. If x is identified by the value 3 in the located context, then x is identified by the value 2 in the held context.
3. If the relationship 'store' holds between x and y, then in the context of serious, x is assigned a value that is twice the value of y's serious attribute plus 3.
4. Once x is designated with the value 3 under the condition of eligible being met, then the value 4 is necessarily assigned to x under the condition of sought.
5. If the value of serious for x is 1, then the value 2 is logically associated with x in the popular context.
6. If x has the value 1 in the sought context, then x is assigned the value 3 in the popular context.
Assertion:
Bessy's serious is less than 3.1.
Step reasoning:
Fact3 -> int0: Parker is 3 serious; Fact5 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Nestor is 2*3+3=9 serious; Fact2 & Rule3 & int1 -> int2: Dugan is 2*9+3=21 serious; Fact0 & Rule3 & int2 -> int3: Melonie is 2*3+3=9 serious; Fact4 & Rule3 & int3 -> int4: Bessy is 2*3+3=9 serious
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. The clarify relationship exists between Carole and Kirk.
1. Bell shoots Carole.
2. The relationship clarify exists between Kirk and Farrah.
3. Kirk blocks Kendre.
4. Carole settles Bell.
5. Carole blocks Bell.
6. The settle relationship exists between Farrah and Kirk.
Rule:
0. Whenever the clarify relationship holds between x and y, it follows that for x, the value of reluctant is represented by multiplying y's reluctant property by 2 and then adding 2.
1. If the value of x in the late field is 1, then the value 2 is assigned to x in the double field.
2. If x is marked with the value 2 in the reluctant context, then x is also assigned the value 2 in the synthetic context.
3. Whenever within x, the value for dead is 1, then the value for late is also 1.
4. If x is recorded with the value 1 in the sweeping context, then x also has the value 1 associated with the double attribute.
5. If the action 'shoot' is performed by x on y, then the value of late for x is inevitably set to 1 times the value of late for y plus 2.
6. If the relation clarify holds between x and y, then the value of x in the dead context is determined by doubling the value of y's dead attribute and adding 1.
Assertion:
Bell's late is less than 5.18.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Farrah is 0 dead; Fact2 & Rule6 & int0 -> int1: Kirk is 2*0+1=1 dead; Fact0 & Rule6 & int1 -> int2: Carole is 2*1+1=3 dead; Rule3 & int2 -> int3: Carole is 1 late; Fact1 & Rule5 & int3 -> int4: Bell is 1+2=3 late
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Garry demonstrates something to Lucina.
1. Casey and Gary maintain a connection defined by codify.
2. The relationship codify defines the interaction between Nannette and Garry.
3. Casey demonstrates something to Lucina.
4. Lucina and Casey maintain a connection defined by codify.
5. Garry and Lucina maintain a relationship described by codify.
6. Nannette demonstrates something to Casey.
Rule:
0. If the relationship "cripple" holds between x and y, then within x, the value of the drawn property is determined by taking the drawn property of y and adding 2.
1. If the attribute influential is assigned the value 1 to x, then in the medical context, x is also recorded with the value 1.
2. If the relationship codify holds between x and y, then x is associated with the property individual, with a value calculated by multiplying y's individual value by 1 and adding 2.
3. Given that x has a value of 3 in the drawn context, it can be inferred that x also has a value of 3 in the acquired context.
4. If the relationship 'nominate' connects x and y, then the value of the individual attribute for x is set to 1 times the value of y's individual attribute plus 4.
5. If the relationship 'demonstrate' holds between x and y, then within the context of medical, x is assigned a value equal to the value of y's medical attribute plus 3.
6. If the relationship codify is satisfied between x and y, then the value of het for x is determined by multiplying the value of het from y by 2 and adding 3.
Assertion:
Nannette's het is greater than 5.06.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Gary is 0 het; Fact1 & Rule6 & int0 -> int1: Casey is 2*0+3=3 het; Fact4 & Rule6 & int1 -> int2: Lucina is 2*3+3=9 het; Fact5 & Rule6 & int2 -> int3: Garry is 2*9+3=21 het; Fact2 & Rule6 & int3 -> int4: Nannette is 2*21+3=45 het
Answer:
True
