Fact:
0. Daveen fabricates something related to Josee.
1. Orson steals from Daveen.
2. The relationship fabricate connects Demetre and Orson.
3. It can be said that Orson fabricates Daveen.
4. Demetre rebukes Daveen.
5. Demetre rebukes Orson.
Rule:
0. If the action fabricate is performed by x on y, then the value in x's premium field is determined by multiplying y's premium value by 4 and adding 7.
1. If the relationship fabricate holds between x and y, then the value of x in the wide context is determined by multiplying y's wide value by 5 and then adding 10.
2. If X's width is annotated as 1, then X's premium is assigned the value 4.
3. If the relationship `fabricate` is established between x and y, then within x, the `risky` attribute is set to a value obtained by multiplying y's `risky` attribute by 5 and then adding 7.
4. If \( x \) is assigned the value 1 in the raised context, then \( x \) is also assigned the value 1 in the risky context.
5. Whenever the value of premium for x is 3, it follows that x is also recorded with 3 under the wide context.
Assertion:
Orson's wide is greater than 21.62.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Josee is 0 wide; Fact0 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Daveen is 5*0+10=10 wide; Fact3 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Orson is 5*10+10=60 wide
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Dareen and Saundra maintain a connection defined by celebrate.
1. In the context of serve, Hamish serves Dareen.
2. The relationship celebrate connects Saundra and Hamish.
3. Vivien ratifies Saundra.
4. In the context of ratify, Hamish and Dareen are connected.
5. Saundra ratifies Hamish.
Rule:
0. If the any attribute of x is marked with 1, then under the threatening context, x is also marked with 1.
1. If the relationship `ratify` holds between x and y, then the value of x's `any` attribute is determined by multiplying y's `any` value by 8 and adding 6.
2. Under the wholesale context, if x is associated with the value 2, then the threatening property for x is defined as 3.
3. If x is identified as any with a value of 4, then it can be inferred that x is attributed the value 1 in the wholesale context.
4. Once the wholesale attribute of x is set to 1, then the european attribute of x is recorded as 2.
5. If \( x \) has the value 2 for the any attribute, then within \( x \), the threatening attribute is also logged as 2.
Assertion:
Saundra's any is less than 11.0.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Dareen is 0 any; Fact4 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Hamish is 8*0+6=6 any; Fact5 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Saundra is 8*6+6=54 any
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Shaughn and Warner have a relationship characterized by slow.
1. Dyana is assigned the value 3 in the colonial context.
2. Dyana surprises Cherlyn.
3. Warner replicates Cherlyn.
4. In the context of slow, Dyana and Shaughn have a connection.
5. The slow correlation exists between Cherlyn and Dyana.
Rule:
0. If the relationship `slow` between x and y is true, then within x, the attribute baltic is assigned a value calculated by multiplying y's baltic value by 1 and adding 3.
1. Whenever x has the value 2 in the supreme attribute, it follows that x also manifests the value 2 in the colonial attribute.
2. Whenever the value 3 is assigned to x for the changed property, x is marked with 2 in the baltic context.
3. If the relationship "slow" holds between x and y, then x is assigned a value in the supreme attribute by multiplying y's supreme attribute by 4 and then adding 8.
4. If the relationship "replicate" holds between x and y, then x's "changed" attribute is set to a value obtained by multiplying y's "changed" attribute by 6 and then adding 3.
5. If x has the value 4 in the supreme context, then x is assigned the value 2 in the baltic context.
Assertion:
Warner's baltic is less than 18.58.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Cherlyn is 0 changed; Fact3 & Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Warner is 6*0+3=3 changed; Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Warner is 2 baltic
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. In the context of withhold, Anurag and Alison have a connection.
1. Anurag spooks Isador.
2. The spook link is observed between Alison and Anurag.
3. The relationship 'withhold' defines the relationship between Rosalind and Anurag.
4. Anurag's headline is Isador.
5. Rosalind spooks Alison.
Rule:
0. If the relationship spook holds between x and y, then within x, the seasonal attribute is set to a value obtained by multiplying y's seasonal value by 2 and adding 4.
1. If the spook relationship holds between x and y, then the value of x in the accumulated property is set to 10 times the value of y plus 5.
2. Under the multilateral context, if x is represented by 4, then x is also associated with the value 1 in the attempted context.
3. If the value of multilateral for x is 2, then the value of attempted for x is also 2.
4. Under the multilateral context, x is recorded with 3, which directly results from x being recorded with 1 in the accumulated context.
5. If the relationship 'headline' connects x and y, then the value of x in the multilateral attribute is determined by multiplying the value of y's multilateral attribute by 9 and then adding 6.
Assertion:
Alison's seasonal is greater than 14.44.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Isador is 0 seasonal; Fact1 & Rule0 & int0 -> int1: Anurag is 2*0+4=4 seasonal; Fact2 & Rule0 & int1 -> int2: Alison is 2*4+4=12 seasonal
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. The relationship 'hold' defines a connection between Kalil and Juditha.
1. Kalil holds Yankee.
2. Kalil and Yankee have a return relationship.
3. Anita and Kalil share a relationship denoted by hold.
4. There is a relation underlie between Anita and Kalil.
5. The relationship 'return' defines a connection between Yankee and Juditha.
Rule:
0. If x is marked with 1 in the serious context, then x is recorded with 3 in the inflationary context.
1. If the return relationship is observed between x and y, then the value of x's optional attribute is set to twice the value of y's optional attribute plus 10.
2. If the underlie relationship between x and y is met, then the value of failing for x is determined by multiplying the failing value of y by 7 and then adding 3.
3. For x, if the value 3 is attributed to x in the failing context, then the value 1 is assigned to x in the optional context.
4. When the return relationship between x and y is established, then in the serious context, x is assigned a value derived by multiplying y's serious attribute by 5 and then adding 10.
5. If the relationship return is established between x and y, then the value of x in the inflationary context is determined by multiplying y's inflationary attribute by 5 and adding 9.
Assertion:
Kalil's optional is greater than 21.72.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Juditha is 0 optional; Fact5 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Yankee is 2*0+10=10 optional; Fact2 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Kalil is 2*10+10=30 optional
Answer:
True
