Fact:
0. Kristel sees Briana.
1. Kristel achieves Agnese.
2. Kristel and Vinnie maintain a connection defined by achieve.
3. Under the relationship see, Briana sees Vinnie.
4. Kristel sees Vinnie.
5. Agnese and Kristel have a relationship denoted by champion.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 2 for responsible, then x naturally has the value 3 for motor.
1. If the value 4 is associated with x in the context of changing, then x is also associated with the value 1 in the context of responsible.
2. If the motor attribute of x is marked with 1, then the changing attribute of x is marked with 3.
3. If the champion relationship between x and y is established, then for x, the value of responsible is set to 2 times the value of y's responsible attribute plus 2.
4. If the value of material for x is 2, then the value of motor for x is 3.
5. If the material of x is 4, then the responsible field of x is marked as 1.
Assertion:
Agnese's motor is greater than 2.29.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Kristel is 0 responsible; Fact5 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Agnese is 2*0+2=2 responsible; Rule0 & int1 -> int2: Agnese is 3 motor
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Giorgi broadcasts to Kathleen.
1. Dennie outpaces Georgy.
2. In the basic category, Georgy is characterized by the value 1.
3. Giorgi obtains something from Kathleen.
4. Georgy broadcasts to Dennie.
5. Giorgi outpaces Dennie.
Rule:
0. When the relationship outpace holds between x and y, then the value of stiff for x is incremented by 1 based on y's value.
1. If the value 2 is assigned to x in the stiff context, then x is also assigned the value 2 in the jobless context.
2. If x is marked as jobless with the value 1, then it inevitably follows that the value of x's basic attribute is 4.
3. If the relationship "outpaces" holds between x and y, then in the basic field for x, the value is set to the value of basic for y plus 1.
4. If x has the value 1 for being independent, then it follows that the value 2 will be associated with x in the jobless context.
5. If the relationship "outpaces" between x and y is met, then in the independent context, x is assigned a value that is 1 times the value of y's independent attribute plus 3.
Assertion:
Giorgi's stiff is greater than 4.76.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Georgy is 0 stiff; Fact1 & Rule0 & int0 -> int1: Dennie is 0+1=1 stiff; Fact5 & Rule0 & int1 -> int2: Giorgi is 1+1=2 stiff
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Vittoria bribes Chrissie.
1. Mayda bribes Vittoria.
2. Under the relationship finance, Vittoria is related to Mayda.
3. Chrissie oversees Frank.
4. Frank oversees Vittoria.
5. The relationship 'oversee' defines a connection between Frank and Mayda.
Rule:
0. If the value of x in the intervening context is 4, then x is assigned the value 2 in the merged context.
1. If the value 3 is associated with x in the social context, then the value 4 is assigned to x in the merged context.
2. When x is characterized by the value 1 in the intervening context, it necessarily follows that x is attributed the value 4 in the unhappy context.
3. If x has the value 2 for merged, then x is described as having the value 1 for unhappy.
4. When the relationship "finance" is satisfied between x and y, the value of x's intervening attribute is set to twice the value of y's intervening attribute plus 3.
5. Whenever x bribes y, in x, the merged attribute is assigned a value that is twice the value of y's merged attribute plus 2.
Assertion:
Mayda's merged is greater than 4.26.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Chrissie is 0 merged; Fact0 & Rule5 & int0 -> int1: Vittoria is 2*0+2=2 merged; Fact1 & Rule5 & int1 -> int2: Mayda is 2*2+2=6 merged
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. In the belgian context, Timotheus is assigned the value 1.
1. The duck association is observed between Harriett and Tucker.
2. Tucker and Eddie have a relationship described by duck.
3. Tucker and Timotheus have a relationship defined by lock.
4. In the context of duck, Timotheus and Harriett are connected.
5. In the fat context, Eddie is associated with the value 4.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 2 in the belgian context, then in the fat context, x is designated with the value 3.
1. Under the accrued context, if x is registered with the value 3, then the fat characteristic of x is attributed the value 4.
2. If x is recorded with the value 4 in the accrued context, then it follows that x will be assigned the value 2 for the fat attribute.
3. If the relationship 'duck' holds between x and y, then within x, the accrued attribute is set to the value of 1 times y plus 4.
4. If the relation 'underline' holds between x and y, then in the fat context, x is assigned a value equal to y's fat value plus 3.
5. If the attribute belgian is set to 1 for x, then x is identified with the value 4 in the zambian category.
Assertion:
Harriett's accrued is less than 4.15.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Eddie is 0 accrued; Fact2 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Tucker is 0+4=4 accrued; Fact1 & Rule3 & int1 -> int2: Harriett is 4+4=8 accrued
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Marshall is in a state of instal with Bertie.
1. Polly provides service to Marshall.
2. Bertie and Marshall are associated through the pump action.
3. Under the relationship pump, Marshall relates to Polly.
4. Polly has the value 3 in the ccc property.
5. The idle property for Correna is assigned the value 4.
Rule:
0. In the context of ccc, x is assigned the value 2 as a result of x being noted as having the value 4 in the fewer context.
1. Within x, the idle attribute is set to the value of 1 times the idle property of y plus 2, which can be inferred from the service relationship between x and y.
2. If the relationship `pump` holds between x and y, then in the context of `persian`, the value of x is determined by doubling the value of y's `persian` attribute and then adding 1.
3. If the relationship instal holds between x and y, then the value of idle for x is determined by multiplying the value of idle for y by 2 and then adding 3.
4. If the value of x's fewer attribute is 2, then the value 4 is associated with x's persian attribute.
5. If the value of idle for x is 1, then the value of x under ccc is 2.
Assertion:
Polly's idle is less than 3.57.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Bertie is 0 idle; Fact0 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Marshall is 2*0+3=3 idle; Fact1 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Polly is 3+2=5 idle
Answer:
False
