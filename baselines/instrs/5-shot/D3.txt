Fact:
0. The relationship stoke holds between Avivah and Candie.
1. Fritz lessens Avivah.
2. Fritz clicks on Avivah.
3. Klarika clicks on Fritz.
4. Candie clicks on Avivah.
5. Klarika stokes Fritz.
Rule:
0. If the relationship 'click' defines a connection between x and y, then the value of x in the quiet context is determined by scaling up the attribute quiet of y by 2 and then adding 3.
1. If the condition for x being sought is met with a value of 3, then x is also associated with the synthetic attribute having a value of 2.
2. When the quiet field for x is set to 4, then the value 4 is likewise assigned to the synthetic field for x.
3. If the value in the quiet field of x is 1, then x is associated with the value 3 in the internal context.
4. If the relationship stoke is fulfilled between x and y, then in the internal context, x is assigned a value calculated by adding 4 to the attribute internal of y.
5. Whenever the relationship 'lessen' holds between x and y, it follows that for x, the internal value is defined by adding 2 to y's internal value.
Assertion:
Klarika's internal is less than 4.55.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Candie is 0 internal; Fact0 & Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Avivah is 0+4=4 internal; Fact1 & Rule5 & int1 -> int2: Fritz is 4+2=6 internal; Fact5 & Rule4 & int2 -> int3: Klarika is 6+4=10 internal
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Mindy spreads a rumor about Moishe.
1. Mindy seizes Moishe.
2. In Mindy, the earned attribute is assigned the value 1.
3. Under the relationship seize, Cherey seizes Mindy.
4. Darryl and Cherey maintain a relationship described by reassert.
5. Moishe seizes Darryl.
Rule:
0. If the relationship "rumor" holds between x and y, then the value of x's pursuant attribute is determined by doubling y's pursuant value and adding 4.
1. If the value 4 is assigned to x under the consecutive attribute, then the value 4 is naturally assigned to x under the earned attribute.
2. Whenever x seizes y, within x, the recurring attribute is recorded by appending 3 to the value associated with the recurring attribute of y.
3. When the value of the field pursuant for x is 1, then the value of the field earned for x is described as 3.
4. If the relationship 'reassert' holds between x and y, then within the context of 'pursuant', the value of x is set to 2 times the value of y's 'pursuant' attribute plus 1.
5. If \( x \) has the value 1 in the recurring context, then \( x \) is identified with the value 4 in the consecutive context.
Assertion:
Cherey's recurring is less than 3.17.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Darryl is 0 recurring; Fact5 & Rule2 & int0 -> int1: Moishe is 0+3=3 recurring; Fact1 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Mindy is 3+3=6 recurring; Fact3 & Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Cherey is 3+3=6 recurring
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Bobette tells Saundra.
1. Gaylene postpones Bobette.
2. Saundra decrys Gaylene.
3. The decry relationship exists between Bobette and Saundra.
4. Bobette decrys Gaylene.
5. The tell relationship exists between Gaylene and Saundra.
Rule:
0. If the relationship 'postpone' holds between x and y, then the value of x's micro property is depicted as appending 2 to y's micro value.
1. If x has the value 2 in the mediterranean property, then the micro field for x is set to 1.
2. Given that the commercial attribute of x is denoted by the value 3, the liquid attribute of x is also assigned the value 3.
3. If x is assigned the value 2 in the micro context, then in the commercial context, x is recorded with the value 3.
4. If the micro field of x is set to 4, then the value 3 is associated with the liquid field for x.
5. If x has the value 1 associated with mediterranean, then x is registered with the value 3 under liquid.
Assertion:
Gaylene's liquid is greater than 4.26.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Bobette is 0 micro; Fact1 & Rule0 & int0 -> int1: Gaylene is 0+2=2 micro; Rule3 & int1 -> int2: Gaylene is 3 commercial; Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Gaylene is 3 liquid
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Nertie dominates Patricia.
1. Nertie blesses Lynea.
2. Nertie crafts Patricia.
3. Lynea dominates Patricia.
4. Lynea and Laird are connected through a relationship defined by craft.
5. Lynea dominates Laird.
Rule:
0. Whenever x is engaged in the act of crafting with y, the value of x's ccc attribute is set to the value of y's ccc attribute plus 2.
1. Whenever x holds the value 2 for cheap, the value 1 is associated with x in the unusual field.
2. For x, if the ccc field is characterized by the value 4, then the disappointing field is labeled as 1.
3. Whenever x is marked as cheap with a value of 4, it is also associated with an unusual value of 3.
4. For x, if ccc is documented with the value 2, then the cheap field of x is marked as 4.
5. If the cheap attribute of x is 1, then the disappointing property of x is assigned the value 3.
Assertion:
Nertie's unusual is less than 4.87.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Patricia is 0 ccc; Fact2 & Rule0 & int0 -> int1: Nertie is 0+2=2 ccc; Rule4 & int1 -> int2: Nertie is 4 cheap; Rule3 & int2 -> int3: Nertie is 3 unusual
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Peta exchanges with Arlyne.
1. Emmott and Arlyne maintain a relationship as described by direct.
2. Emmott exchanges with Peta.
3. It can be said that Arlyne affects Peta.
4. Farica and Emmott maintain a relationship as described by exchange.
5. There is a direct association between Emmott and Farica.
Rule:
0. If within x, the value of apart is 1, then within x, the value of israeli is noted as 2.
1. If the relationship `affect` holds between x and y, then the value of x in the israeli context is determined by doubling y's israeli value and then adding 4.
2. If the exchange relationship between x and y is fulfilled, then within x, the coming property is assigned a value that is twice the value of y's coming property plus 2.
3. If the attribute blue is associated with x having a value of 3, then it can be deduced that under the attribute apart, x is characterized by a value of 1.
4. If the relationship 'affect' holds between x and y, then the value of x's blue attribute is set to the value of y's blue attribute plus 1.
5. For x, if the value of coming is 1, then the value of apart for x is also 1.
Assertion:
Farica's coming is less than 4.15.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Arlyne is 0 coming; Fact0 & Rule2 & int0 -> int1: Peta is 2*0+2=2 coming; Fact2 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Emmott is 2*2+2=6 coming; Fact4 & Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Farica is 2*6+2=14 coming
Answer:
False
