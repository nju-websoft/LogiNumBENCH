7. Orren and Madge have a relationship described by stake.
Rule:
0. If the staple attribute of x is set to 1, then the durable attribute of x is also represented by 1.
1. If the value of lesser for x is 3, then the value of weakening for x is 4.
2. Whenever the relationship 'mitigate' connects x and y, the value of lesser in x is determined by adding 3 to the lesser attribute of y.
3. Within x, the weakening attribute is marked as 4, which is a foreseen outcome when x is categorized as egyptian.
4. If the relationship 'invest' exists between x and y, then x is associated with a value for the durable attribute that is 5 times the value of y's durable attribute plus 6.
5. If the value of the made property for x is 4, then the value of the staple property for x is also 4.
6. If the value of studied for x is 4, then the value of staple for x is also 4.
7. If the relationship `invest` holds between x and y, then in the context of `lesser`, the value for x is determined by scaling the value of `lesser` from y by 8 and then adding 4.
8. If the value 4 is associated with x in the context of weakening, then the value 4 is also directly assigned to x in the context of made.
9. Whenever the relation 'stake' holds between x and y, the value of x's staple attribute is determined by multiplying y's staple attribute by 3 and then adding 8.
Assertion:
Orren's staple is greater than 14.26.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Noell is 0 lesser; Fact4 & Rule7 & int0 -> int1: Zerk is 8*0+4=4 lesser; Fact6 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Madge is 4+3=7 lesser; Rule1 & int2 -> int3: Madge is 4 weakening; Rule8 & int3 -> int4: Madge is 4 made; Rule5 & int4 -> int5: Madge is 4 staple; Fact7 & Rule9 & int5 -> int6: Orren is 3*4+8=20 staple

5. Roice writes Anne-Mar.
6. Gleda is assigned the value 4 in the negative context.
7. There is a relation rewrite between Johnny and Maury.
Rule:
0. If the value of subsequent for x is 2, then the value of negative for x is defined as 1.
1. Under the cut context, the value of the cut attribute for x is determined by multiplying the value of y's cut attribute by 4 and then adding 1, which can be inferred if x is in a state of copying with respect to y.
2. When the relationship rewrite is established between x and y, the subsequent attribute of x is assigned a value obtained by doubling the subsequent attribute of y and then adding 2.
3. If the value of x in the negative property is 1, then the value of x in the christian property is 3.
4. If the relationship "inspire" holds between x and y, then the value of the subsequent attribute for x is set to 3 times the value of y's subsequent attribute plus 4.
5. If the value of wanted for x is 2, then x is assigned the value 2 for cut.
6. If the relationship "inspire" holds between x and y, then x is assigned a value for the wanted attribute that is derived by multiplying y's wanted value by 4 and then adding 8.
7. If the cut attribute of x is assigned the value 3, then the subsequent property of x is assigned the value 2.
8. If the value 3 is associated with x in the christian context, then the value 4 is linked to x in the initial context.
9. If the action 'pump' is observed between x and y, then x is designated with an initial value calculated by multiplying y's initial value by 5 and then adding 10.
Assertion:
Britni's initial is greater than 14.23.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Anne-Mar is 0 subsequent; Fact2 & Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Maury is 3*0+4=4 subsequent; Fact7 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Johnny is 2*4+2=10 subsequent; Rule0 & int2 -> int3: Johnny is 1 negative; Rule3 & int3 -> int4: Johnny is 3 christian; Rule8 & int4 -> int5: Johnny is 4 initial; Fact4 & Rule9 & int5 -> int6: Britni is 5*4+10=30 initial

5. Cybel reflects with regard to Doloritas.
6. Jemmie is assigned the value 2 for the very property.
7. Kerianne confronts Jose.
Rule:
0. If the due field in x has the value 2, then x is assigned the value 3 under saved.
1. If x has the value 3 in the congressional context, then it logically follows that x is assigned the value 2 in the strategic context.
2. If the strategic attribute of x is recorded as 3, then the ordered attribute of x will hold the value 2.
3. When x is marked as due with the value 3, it subsequently has the value 2 associated with ordered.
4. If the confrontation between x and y is observed, then x exhibits an increased value in the saved attribute, calculated by doubling y's saved value and then adding 9.
5. If the relationship "discredit" holds between x and y, then in the congressional field, the value of x is set to the value of y's congressional attribute plus 5.
6. If the relationship discredit holds between x and y, then the value in x's due field is determined by multiplying y's due value by 4 and then adding 2.
7. If there exists a relationship `thumb` between x and y, then for x, the value `very` is documented as 4 times the value of `very` in y plus 7.
8. If the thumb relationship holds between x and y, then x's ordered property is set to twice the value of y's ordered property plus 8.
9. When it can be said that x reflects y, the due property for x is represented by the value obtained by multiplying y's due attribute by 9 and then adding 4.
Assertion:
Jemmie's saved is greater than 14.78.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Jemmie is 0 due; Fact3 & Rule9 & int0 -> int1: Doloritas is 9*0+4=4 due; Fact5 & Rule9 & int1 -> int2: Cybel is 9*4+4=40 due; Fact2 & Rule6 & int2 -> int3: Jose is 4*40+2=162 due; Rule0 & int3 -> int4: Jose is 3 saved; Fact7 & Rule4 & int4 -> int5: Kerianne is 2*3+9=15 saved; Fact0 & Rule4 & int5 -> int6: Jemmie is 2*15+9=39 saved

Rule:
0. If x has the value 4 in the all context, then it is documented that x has the value 1 in the secure context.
1. If the revise relationship is observed between x and y, then the occidental field of x is assigned a value calculated by tripling the occidental value of y and adding 7.
2. Whenever the relationship "revise" holds between x and y, x's value in the "bigger" context is determined by tripling y's "bigger" value and then adding 4.
3. If the relationship 'feel' defines the relationship between x and y, then the value of x's thin attribute is determined by multiplying y's thin attribute value by 7 and adding 5.
4. If the value of all for x is 1, then the value of secure for x is registered as 3.
5. If the relationship 'revise' is satisfied between x and y, then x is marked with a value in the 'some' field, which is obtained by scaling y's 'some' attribute by 4 and then appending 3.
6. If the relationship deplete holds between x and y, then in x, the value of all is set to be three times the value of all for y, plus 4.
7. If the relationship 'revise' holds between x and y, then the value of x in the secure field is set to 3 times the secure value of y plus 1.
8. If the combat relationship between x and y is established, then the value of x in the secure field is determined by multiplying y's secure value by 4 and then adding 9.
9. If the value of secure for x is 2, then it can be inferred that the value of bigger for x is 3.
Assertion:
Kacey's secure is less than 12.04.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Krishna is 0 all; Fact3 & Rule6 & int0 -> int1: Yule is 3*0+4=4 all; Rule0 & int1 -> int2: Yule is 1 secure; Fact0 & Rule7 & int2 -> int3: Scotti is 3*1+1=4 secure; Fact6 & Rule7 & int3 -> int4: Krishna is 3*4+1=13 secure; Fact7 & Rule8 & int4 -> int5: Merrel is 4*13+9=61 secure; Fact1 & Rule8 & int5 -> int6: Kacey is 4*61+9=253 secure

7. Eve believes Joey.
Rule:
0. For \( x \), if the value of compound is 1, then the value of complex for \( x \) is 4.
1. If the relationship "believe" holds between x and y, then within the context of inside, the value of x is determined by adding 2 to y's value.
2. If the relationship 'sweeten' holds between x and y, then the value of x's complex attribute is set to 9 times the value of y's complex attribute plus 7.
3. Given that x has the value 3 for unsuccessful, it follows that x has the value 2 for industrialised.
4. In the context of seduce, if the relationship between x and y is established, then the value of x's inside attribute is set to 7 times the value of y's inside attribute plus 1.
5. If the inside attribute of x is marked with 3, then under complex, x is marked with 2.
6. If x is marked with the value 2 in the industrialised context, then x is assigned the value 1 for inside.
7. If the seduce relationship is observed between x and y, then the value in x's right field is determined by adding 1 to the value of y's right attribute.
8. If x has the value 2 in the multiple attribute, then the value 3 is assigned to the unsuccessful property of x.
9. If the value of complex for x is 4, then x is naturally designated with the value 1 for industrialised.
Assertion:
