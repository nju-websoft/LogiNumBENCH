Fact:
0. The value for Vasili in the violated context is 2.
1. Butler bribes Vasili.
2. In the context of violated, Archy is marked with the value 4.
3. Under the relationship confront, Archy interacts with Cilka.
4. Vasili nominates Archy.
5. The nomination association is observed between Butler and Vasili.
Rule:
0. If x is marked as violated with a value of 1, then in the context of european, x is annotated with a value of 2.
1. If the relationship 'confront' holds between x and y, then the value of x's european attribute is determined by multiplying y's european attribute by 4 and adding 7.
2. Whenever the relationship "nominate" holds between x and y, it follows that the value of determining for x is documented as 5 times the value of determining for y, plus 9.
3. Whenever the relationship "confront" is established between x and y, the value of x in the determining context is set to be 5 times the value of y's determining attribute plus 1.
4. If the value of European for x is 2, then the value of Off for x is also 2.
5. If the value of the off field for x is 1, then x is assigned the value 4 in the european context.
Assertion:
Butler's determining is less than 33.11.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Cilka is 0 determining; Fact3 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Archy is 5*0+1=1 determining; Fact4 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Vasili is 5*1+9=14 determining; Fact5 & Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Butler is 5*14+9=79 determining
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. In the context of outbid, Marga relates to Caron.
1. Nancee cripples Adelind.
2. Adelind and Marga have a relationship characterized by cripple.
3. Nancee outbids Caron.
4. The mix correlation exists between Caron and Adelind.
5. For Nancee, the value 4 is assigned to running.
Rule:
0. If the relationship cripple holds between x and y, then within x, the final attribute is set to a value obtained by multiplying y's final attribute by 6 and adding 3.
1. When the value 3 is associated with x under the final context, x is then noted to have the value 2 in the sixth attribute.
2. Whenever x is associated with the value 3 under the running attribute, the sought field of x is represented by 2.
3. If x has the value 4 in the final context, then x is assigned the value 1 for the sixth attribute.
4. If the value of sought for x is 1, then the value of final for x is specified as 4.
5. Given that x is attributed the value 2 in the final property, it is also documented with the value 2 in the sought property.
Assertion:
Nancee's sixth is less than 29.48.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Marga is 0 final; Fact2 & Rule0 & int0 -> int1: Adelind is 6*0+3=3 final; Fact1 & Rule0 & int1 -> int2: Nancee is 6*3+3=21 final; Rule1 & int2 -> int3: Nancee is 2 sixth
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. In the micro context, Jacquelynn is assigned the value 1.
1. Deb is mean to Jacquelynn.
2. Jacquelynn and Deb have a relationship defined by determine.
3. Deb and Katinka travel together.
4. Belia and Jacquelynn are connected through a relationship defined by determine.
5. Deb is mean to Katinka.
Rule:
0. Whenever the controlling attribute of x is set to 4, the value 2 is recorded for x in the micro context.
1. If the relationship "determine" holds between x and y, then the value of x in the "set" context is determined by multiplying the value of y's "set" attribute by 7 and adding 6.
2. In the context of set, x is assigned the value 3 if the huge attribute is associated with the value 3 in x.
3. If the travel relationship between x and y is present, then the value of x's set attribute is determined by multiplying y's set feature by 10 and adding 3.
4. If the value of huge for x is 4, then x is assigned the value 1 for the micro property.
5. If the relationship "determine" connects x and y, then the value of x in the "huge" attribute is derived by multiplying y's "huge" value by 8 and then adding 2.
Assertion:
Belia's set is greater than 27.68.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Katinka is 0 set; Fact3 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Deb is 10*0+3=3 set; Fact2 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Jacquelynn is 7*3+6=27 set; Fact4 & Rule1 & int2 -> int3: Belia is 7*27+6=195 set
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. The cleared attribute of Germaine is assigned the value 1.
1. A triple link is observed between Izzi and Lark.
2. Lark and Linus are connected through a relationship described by triple.
3. Lark bans Germaine.
4. Lark and Izzi engage in a conduct relationship.
5. Under the relationship triple, Germaine relates to Izzi.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 1 for little, then in the context of previous, x naturally takes the value 2.
1. If x is associated with the value 3 under the listed attribute, then in the cleared context, x is recorded with the value 1.
2. If the relationship 'triple' holds between x and y, then the value of x's previous property is determined by adding 2 to the previous property of y.
3. If the value 4 is assigned to x for the cleared attribute, then it follows that the value 1 is assigned to x for the little attribute.
4. Whenever x has the value 3 in the little context, it is noted as having the value 2 in the listed context.
5. If the value of listed for x is 1, then the value of previous for x is 4.
Assertion:
Germaine's previous is less than 33.79.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Linus is 0 previous; Fact2 & Rule2 & int0 -> int1: Lark is 0+2=2 previous; Fact1 & Rule2 & int1 -> int2: Izzi is 2+2=4 previous; Fact5 & Rule2 & int2 -> int3: Germaine is 2+2=4 previous
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. In the context of incorporate, Clement and Phebe are connected.
1. Skippy flushes Phebe.
2. The relationship incorporate holds between Phebe and Grover.
3. Grover and Skippy are related through the incorporate relationship.
4. Skippy is assigned the value 3 in the surrounding context.
5. The flush correlation exists between Grover and Clement.
Rule:
0. If the relation flush holds between x and y, then the value of x in the republican category is determined by multiplying y's republican value by 10 and adding 6.
1. If the relationship 'incorporate' holds between x and y, then x's surrounding attribute is set to a value obtained by multiplying y's surrounding attribute by 10 and adding 1.
2. If X has the value 1 for the adopted property, then X naturally receives the value 2 for the surrounding property.
3. Whenever the relationship 'view' holds between x and y, the value of x's republican attribute is determined by multiplying y's republican value by 7 and then adding 3.
4. If the value of surrounding for x is 2, then it can be inferred that the value of republican for x is also 2.
5. If x is assigned the value 1 under republican, then it can be inferred that x holds the value 4 under surrounding.
Assertion:
Clement's surrounding is less than 41.04.
Step reasoning:
Fact4 -> int0: Skippy is 3 surrounding; Fact3 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Grover is 10*3+1=31 surrounding; Fact2 & Rule1 & int1 -> int2: Phebe is 10*31+1=311 surrounding; Fact0 & Rule1 & int2 -> int3: Clement is 10*1+1=11 surrounding
Answer:
True
