Fact:
0. There is a relation screen between Annelise and Pearla.
1. Ronald emphasizes Annelise.
2. Under the relationship zip, Ede is related to Ronald.
3. Ronald and Pearla maintain a relationship as described by screen.
4. In the sharing context, Pearla is characterized by the value 3.
5. It can be said that Ronald emphasizes Ede.
Rule:
0. If the screen relationship holds between x and y, then the value of x's sharing attribute is determined by multiplying y's sharing value by 3 and then adding 8.
1. If the value 3 is associated with x in the brown context, then it can be inferred that the value 1 is associated with x for the concluded attribute.
2. If the zip relationship between x and y is satisfied, then the value of x in the iranian field is determined by multiplying y's iranian value by 8 and then adding 5.
3. If the relationship `screen` holds between x and y, then for x, the value of the brown attribute is determined by multiplying y's brown value by 7 and then adding 4.
4. If the screen relationship between x and y is established, then in the concluded context, x is assigned a value calculated by multiplying y's concluded attribute by 3 and then adding 2.
5. If x has the value 2 for the iranian property, then in x, the sharing attribute is assigned the value 3.
Assertion:
Annelise's brown is less than 6.53.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Pearla is 0 brown; Fact0 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Annelise is 7*0+4=4 brown
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Tobi and Winn have a relationship defined by sting.
1. Tiphani stings Winn.
2. Winn hampers Tiphani.
3. The conflicting attribute of Tiphani is recorded with a value of 3.
4. Winn and Tobi have a relationship described by vary.
5. Marcelo and Winn have a relationship defined by hamper.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 2 for the conflicting property, then the ready field of x is also assigned the value 2.
1. Whenever the value of x in the conflicting context is 3, then x is assigned the value 4 in the ready context.
2. If the relationship `vary` holds between x and y, then the value of `conflicting` for x is determined by tripling the value of the `conflicting` attribute of y and adding 8.
3. Given that x is characterized by 3 in the negative context, it follows that x possesses the value 4 in the ready context.
4. For x, if the value 1 is assigned to ready, then the value 3 will be assigned to illegal.
5. If the relationship `hamper` is observed between x and y, then within the illegal context, the value of x is determined by multiplying y's illegal value by 10 and then adding 9.
Assertion:
Tiphani's ready is less than 2.89.
Step reasoning:
Fact3 -> int0: Tiphani is 3 conflicting; Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Tiphani is 4 ready
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. The relationship 'redistribute' defines a connection between Jephthah and Katherina.
1. Katherina redistributes with Janis.
2. The relationship float describes the connection between Sergio and Jephthah.
3. The float relationship is noted between Katherina and Janis.
4. There exists a relationship float between Katherina and Sergio.
5. The value 1 is associated with Katherina in the amended context.
Rule:
0. If X is recorded with 4 in the het context, then the higher field for X will be set to 3.
1. In the amended context, the value associated with x is determined by adding 8 to the value of the amended characteristic of y, whenever the get relationship between x and y is fulfilled.
2. If x is assigned the value 4 in the old field, then x is associated with the value 2 in the amended attribute.
3. If x is associated with the value 1 in the het context, then it can be deduced that x is associated with the value 3 in the amended context.
4. Given that x is associated with the value 4 in the higher context, the amended attribute of x is annotated with the value 3.
5. If the action redistribute is performed between x and y, then x is described by augmenting y's het value by 4 within the het context.
Assertion:
Katherina's het is greater than 6.51.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Janis is 0 het; Fact1 & Rule5 & int0 -> int1: Katherina is 0+4=4 het
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. There is a thumb association between Garnet and Carleen.
1. Garnet sweetens Carleen.
2. Dacy and Garnet maintain a relationship described by renew.
3. Garnet renewes Carleen.
4. Carmita sweetens Carleen.
5. Garnet renews its state in relation to Carmita.
Rule:
0. The east property of x is assigned the value 1 if x is identified with 1 in the greatest context.
1. If there is a relation 'thumb' between x and y, then the value of x's greatest property is determined by multiplying y's greatest property by 8 and then adding 7.
2. If the value of 2 is assigned to x in the developed context, then the value of 3 is assigned to x in the korean context.
3. If the relationship 'thumb' holds between x and y, then x is assigned a value in the developed category by multiplying y's value for developed by 3 and then adding 4.
4. If the relationship `sweeten` is established between x and y, then the value of x's east attribute is determined by multiplying y's east attribute by 10 and adding 2.
5. If the greatest property for x is depicted as 2, then x is documented with 4 under the developed category.
Assertion:
Carmita's east is less than 4.45.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Carleen is 0 east; Fact4 & Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Carmita is 10*0+2=2 east
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Melvyn pumps for Agatha.
1. In the after context, Doria is assigned the value 2.
2. The relationship wreck exists between Agatha and Libby.
3. In the context of pumping, Doria and Agatha are connected.
4. In the steady context, Melvyn is annotated with the value 1.
5. Libby pumps for Melvyn.
Rule:
0. If the relationship 'wreck' holds between x and y, then in the context of enlarged, x is assigned a value equal to 8 times the value of y's enlarged attribute plus 9.
1. If the relationship 'wreck' holds between x and y, then for x, the value of the 'after' attribute is determined by multiplying y's 'after' attribute by 8 and then adding 7.
2. If the relationship 'wreck' holds between x and y, then the value of x's resistant attribute is determined by multiplying y's resistant value by 7 and adding 10.
3. Given that the value of steady for x is 4, it can be inferred that under the context of enlarged, x is designated with the value 3.
4. If the attribute enlarged for x is set to 4, then the attribute steady for x is annotated with the value 2.
5. If the relationship "circulate" between x and y is fulfilled, then the value of x in the resistant category is determined by multiplying y's resistant value by 7 and then adding 3.
Assertion:
Agatha's after is greater than 4.41.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Libby is 0 after; Fact2 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Agatha is 8*0+7=7 after
Answer:
True
