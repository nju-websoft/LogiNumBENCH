Rule:
0. If the value of statutory for x is 2, then it follows that the assigned field for x will be marked with 3.
1. If the relationship "suit" holds between x and y, then x is assigned the value of y's "assigned" attribute plus 1.
2. If x has the value 1 for the assigned characteristic, then x is assigned the value 3 under the unrealistic context.
3. If the relationship 'incorporate' holds between x and y, then the value of x in the trapped field is determined by scaling y's trapped value by 2 and then adding 1.
4. If the send relationship is established between x and y, then the value of x's statutory attribute is set to 2 times the value of y's statutory attribute plus 1.
5. If the statutory attribute of x is recorded with the value 1, then the proper attribute of x will naturally be assigned the value 3.
6. Under the wide context, x is assigned the value 2, provided that within x, the statutory attribute is noted as 4.
7. If the relationship 'incorporate' holds between x and y, then within x, the value for the attribute 'wide' is determined by doubling the 'wide' attribute of y and then adding 4.
8. If X is categorized as unrealistic with a value of 2, then within X, the assigned attribute is set to 4.
9. If the relationship 'incorporate' holds between x and y, then in the unrealistic context, x is assigned a value that is 1 more than the value assigned to the unrealistic attribute of y.
Assertion:
Penni's unrealistic is greater than 3.71.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Cyb is 0 unrealistic; Fact2 & Rule9 & int0 -> int1: Catlaina is 0+1=1 unrealistic; Fact1 & Rule9 & int1 -> int2: Ramesh is 1+1=2 unrealistic; Fact4 & Rule9 & int2 -> int3: Piotr is 1+1=2 unrealistic; Rule8 & int3 -> int4: Piotr is 4 assigned; Fact0 & Rule1 & int4 -> int5: Penni is 4+1=5 assigned; Rule2 & int5 -> int6: Penni is 3 unrealistic

2. Within x, if the value 1 is associated with the flowing property, then the coordinate property of x is also identified with 1.
3. If the coordinate field of x is denoted with 2, then x is attributed with 3 in the demanding category.
4. If the turned property of x is represented by 1, then the flowing characteristic of x is indicated by 2.
5. If the relationship 'see' holds between x and y, then the value of x in the adequate field is determined by doubling y's adequate value and adding 2.
6. When x is characterized by 3 in the turned context, it implies that x is represented by 4 in the iron context.
7. If the demanding field for x contains the value 4, then x is documented with the value 1 in the turned field.
8. If the coordinate field of x is marked as 1, then the value 1 is also logged for x under demanding.
9. If the relationship 'cure' is established between x and y, then for x, the value of flowing is determined by multiplying y's flowing attribute by 2 and then adding 1.
Assertion:
Jody's demanding is greater than 3.79.
Step reasoning:

Rule:
0. If x has the value 3 in the provincial context, then in the fair context, x is assigned the value 2.
1. If the universal attribute for x is set to 1, then the value 4 is associated with x in the waste context.
2. If x has the value 4 for protective, then in the bigger context, x is noted to have the value 2.
3. In the waste category, if x is characterized by 4, then x is recorded as having a value of 4 in the bigger context.
4. If the relationship 'ask' holds between x and y, then x's provincial attribute is stored for y, with the value calculated as 1y + 1.
5. If x is marked with 1 in the provincial context, then the value of x in the universal context is defined as 2.
6. When the provincial attribute of x is assigned a value of 2, then the fair attribute assigns x a value of 3.
7. If the relation "equal" holds between x and y, then in the universal context, x is marked with a value obtained by multiplying y's universal attribute by 2 and then adding 1.
8. If the indefinite attribute of x is represented by 2, then the waste attribute of x is also defined as 2.
9. Whenever the relationship "impress" holds between x and y, the value of x in the waste field is determined by doubling y's waste value and then adding 1.
Assertion:
Dorri's bigger is greater than 3.46.

Fact:
0. Beau's leading is recorded with the value 4.
1. Beau and Gabriel are involved in a relationship described by commit.
2. Erasmus and Dabney are connected through a relationship described by commit.
3. Under the stretch context, Dabney is designated with the value 1.
4. Erasmus ignores Rosalinda.
5. Dabney sweetens Gabriel.
6. Erasmus outbids Rosalinda.
7. The relationship channel establishes a connection between Gabriel and Erasmus.
Rule:
0. If the relationship outbid holds between x and y, then the value of the leading attribute for x is determined by multiplying y's leading attribute by 2 and then adding 1.
1. If X has the value 4 for the short attribute, then it is concluded that X is associated with the value 1 for the entitled attribute.
2. If the channel relationship exists between x and y, then in the entitled context, x is assigned a value that is 1 plus y's entitled value.
3. When the entitled attribute of x is marked with 1, then under the individual context, x is indicated by the value 4.
4. If the value of the stretch field for x is 2, then it inevitably follows that the delayed field for x is 4.
5. Within x, the short field is populated with the value obtained by adding 2 to the value held by y for the attribute short, as defined by the relationship commit between x and y.
6. If the relationship `sweeten` holds between x and y, then in the context of individual, x is assigned a value that is twice the value of y's individual characteristic, plus 2.
7. In the context of individual, if x holds the value 4, then x is indicated to have the value 2 for short.
8. Whenever the relationship 'commit' holds between x and y, it follows that for x, the potential attribute is represented by a value calculated by doubling y's potential value and then adding 1.
9. If the delayed attribute of x is associated with the value 2, then the stretch property of x is marked with the value 1.
Assertion:
