Fact:
0. The relationship limit defines the relationship between Andre and Randy.
1. Under the relationship give, Clare gives to Andre.
2. Francesmary gives to Randy.
3. The limit correlation exists between Francesmary and Clare.
4. Francesmary and Randy are connected through a relationship described by associate.
5. Under the relationship limit, Francesmary is related to Andre.
Rule:
0. For \( x \), if the value 1 is associated with the agreed property, then \( x \) is also identified with the value 4 for the future property.
1. If the relationship 'give' is fulfilled between x and y, then in the digital context, x is assigned a value equal to 2 times the digital value of y plus 2.
2. If the value of the agreed property for x is 2, then x is also attributed with the value 2 in the future category.
3. If x has the value 1 for steady, then in the digital context, x will have the value 2.
4. If x is associated with the value 2 in the steady attribute, then it can be inferred that x is represented by the value 4 in the digital context.
5. If the relationship 'give' is fulfilled between x and y, then for x, the value of the future attribute is determined by multiplying y's future attribute by 2 and then adding 1.
Assertion:
Francesmary's digital is greater than 3.76.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Randy is 0 digital; Fact2 & Rule1 & int0 -> int1: Francesmary is 2*0+2=2 digital
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Sonia dominates Merril.
1. Margareta and Paulita are connected through a decrease relationship.
2. Merril experiences a decrease in relation to Paulita.
3. Merril dominates Margareta.
4. Merril exhibits Margareta.
5. In the lucky context, Paulita is characterized by the value 4.
Rule:
0. If x has the value 2 under lucky, then it follows that x has the value 4 under white.
1. Upon satisfying the relationship where x dominates y, the value of x's contractual attribute is set to the value of y's contractual attribute plus 2.
2. Within x, if the value 3 is assigned to the lucky field, then the opening field is also set to 3.
3. If the value of the contractual field for x is 3, then the value 2 is assigned to the opening field for x.
4. If x has the value 1 for the lucky attribute, then x is described as having the value 3 for the white attribute.
5. If the relationship 'decrease' is established between x and y, then within x, the lucky attribute is set to twice the value of y's lucky attribute plus 2.
Assertion:
Margareta's lucky is greater than 3.36.
Step reasoning:
Fact5 -> int0: Paulita is 4 lucky; Fact1 & Rule5 & int0 -> int1: Margareta is 2*4+2=10 lucky
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. Eloisa rectifies Tiffani.
1. Tiffani and Eloisa have a relationship characterized by buck.
2. Valli and Eloisa maintain a relationship described by buck.
3. Eloisa buckles Julianna.
4. In the mean context, Eloisa is marked with the value 2.
5. The relationship rectify exists between Julianna and Tiffani.
Rule:
0. If for x, the value 2 represents trying, then it can be inferred that the value 2 also marks the ample field of x.
1. If \( x \) has the value 3 for the attribute "trying," then \( x \) also has the value 3 for the attribute "territorial."
2. Given the relationship 'forgive' between x and y, within x, the value for ample is the value of y's ample attribute plus 3.
3. When x has the value 4 in the ample context, it is then described as having the value 2 in the mean context.
4. Whenever the relationship "buck" holds between x and y, the value of trying for x is documented as twice the trying value of y plus one.
5. If the value 3 is assigned to x under the mean attribute, then it follows that x will have the value 2 under the territorial attribute.
Assertion:
Eloisa's trying is less than 2.72.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Julianna is 0 trying; Fact3 & Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Eloisa is 2*0+1=1 trying
Answer:
True

Fact:
0. The relationship liquidate establishes a connection between Nolie and Helaine.
1. Regina and Helaine have a relationship described by fabricate.
2. Regina fabricates something involving Nolie.
3. Quinta and Helaine have a relationship described by liquidate.
4. The relationship liquidate exists between Regina and Quinta.
5. The relationship pull defines a connection between Helaine and Quinta.
Rule:
0. If the value of successive for x is 3, then it inevitably follows that the value of responsible for x is 2.
1. If x has the value 4 in the successive context, then the value of fourth for x is set to 1.
2. Whenever x is described as having the value 3 under the spare attribute, x is then documented as having the value 4 under the fourth attribute.
3. If the relationship `liquidate` between `x` and `y` is fulfilled, then the value of the fourth field for `x` is determined to be 2 times the value of the fourth field of `y` plus 4.
4. When the relationship 'pull' holds between x and y, the value of x in the responsible field is determined by appending 3 to the value of y's responsible field.
5. If x has the value 1 for responsible, then the value 2 is associated with x in the fourth context.
Assertion:
Quinta's fourth is less than 3.12.
Step reasoning:
Default -> int0: Helaine is 0 fourth; Fact3 & Rule3 & int0 -> int1: Quinta is 2*0+4=4 fourth
Answer:
False

Fact:
0. Slade and Marena engage in a relationship described by juggle.
1. In the unnamed context, Trudi is assigned the value 1.
2. For the unnamed attribute, Marena is assigned the value 2.
3. Marena and Sarene engage in a relationship described by juggle.
4. In the weakening context, Sarene is described by the value 1.
5. Trudi's weakening characteristic is assigned the value 1.
Rule:
0. If the value of saudi for x is 3, then the value of unnamed for x is 4.
1. Whenever x is documented with the value 3 for weakening, it follows that x is marked with the value 4 for saudi.
2. If the indefinite field of x is associated with the value 1, then in the saudi context, x naturally holds the value 2.
3. When the relationship 'create' holds between x and y, the value of x's saudi attribute is determined by adding 4 to the saudi attribute of y.
4. If x has the value 2 in the unnamed context, then it follows that the weakening field of x is characterized by 3.
5. For x, if the indefinite property is manifested with a value of 2, then the value 4 is assigned to the saudi property.
Assertion:
Marena's weakening is greater than 3.57.
Step reasoning:
Fact2 -> int0: Marena is 2 unnamed; Rule4 & int0 -> int1: Marena is 3 weakening
Answer:
False
